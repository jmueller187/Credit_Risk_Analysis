# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Apply machine learning techniques to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of our analysis was to apply machine learning to a credit card dataset from LendingClub (a peer to peer lending service company) in order to predict credit risk. We were tasked with using the fillowing six different sampling algorithms:<br>
- Oversampling with RandomOverSampler and SMOTE
- Undersampling with ClusterCentroids
- Combination over- and undersampling with SMOTEENN
- Ensemble sampling with BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier

After sampling the data with each of these algorighms, we evaluated metrics we gathered to determine which model (if any) could be used to predict future high risk customers.

## Results:
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary:
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
